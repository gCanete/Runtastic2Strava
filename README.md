I recently changed from the Runtastic app to Strava and was wondering how I could import all my old data. This program takes into account the authentication (OAuth2) needed to create new activities in Strava. It opens a web browser with Undetected Chrome Driver, and once you login and grant access, you theen receive your access and refresh tokens which are used to access the Starva API and create new activities.
The 2 things needed to run the program are:
- Download the sport-sessions from Adidas (it may take some days).
- A Strava account.
